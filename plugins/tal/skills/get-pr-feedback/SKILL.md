# Get PR Feedback

Fetch PR review comments from GitHub as structured threads with conversation context.

## Flags Quick Reference

- **`-a`** : Show only actionable threads (unresolved + not outdated) - **recommended for most use cases**
- **`-f`** : Full mode with diff_hunk fields (default: compact without diff_hunks)
- **`-o`** : Sort oldest-first (default: newest-first for most relevant feedback)
- **`-v`** : Verbose diagnostic output to stderr

## Why Use This Skill

This skill provides structured access to PR review comment threads with accurate resolution and outdated status that's not easily available through basic `gh pr view` commands. It:

- Fetches ALL review comment threads with full conversation context
- Tracks resolved/outdated status (requires GraphQL API)
- Organizes comments into threads for easy navigation
- Returns structured JSON for programmatic filtering
- Auto-detects PR from current branch or accepts explicit PR/comment URLs

**Use this instead of**:
- `gh pr view --comments` (doesn't show threaded conversations or resolution status)
- `gh api` calls (requires manual GraphQL query construction)
- Manual web browsing (not automatable)

## Quick Start

**Most common usage** (auto-detect PR from current branch, compact by default):
```bash
${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/skills/get-pr-feedback/get-pr-comments.sh
```

**Actionable threads only** (recommended - filters to unresolved + not outdated):
```bash
${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/skills/get-pr-feedback/get-pr-comments.sh -a
```

**Full mode with diff_hunks** (opt-in to include code context, increases output by 70%):
```bash
${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/skills/get-pr-feedback/get-pr-comments.sh -af
```

**Combined flags example** (actionable + full mode + oldest-first):
```bash
${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/skills/get-pr-feedback/get-pr-comments.sh -afo 12345
```

**Specific PR**:
```bash
${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/skills/get-pr-feedback/get-pr-comments.sh 12345
${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/skills/get-pr-feedback/get-pr-comments.sh https://github.com/owner/repo/pull/123
```

**Filter manually with jq** (if not using -a flag):
```bash
${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/skills/get-pr-feedback/get-pr-comments.sh | \
  jq '[.[] | select(.resolved == false and .outdated == false)]'
```

## Usage

The skill accepts the following input formats:

- **No argument**: Auto-detects PR from the current git branch
- **PR number**: Fetches comments for a specific PR number (e.g., `12345`)
- **PR URL**: Accepts full GitHub PR URL (e.g., `https://github.com/owner/repo/pull/123`)
- **Comment URL**: Fetches only the thread containing a specific comment (e.g., `https://github.com/owner/repo/pull/123#discussion_r123456`)

**Flags:**
- **-v**: Enables verbose mode for diagnostic output to stderr
- **-a**: Filters to actionable threads only (unresolved AND not outdated). Recommended for large PRs
- **-f**: Full mode - includes diff_hunk fields (70% larger output). By default, diff_hunks are excluded since Claude can read files directly
- **-o**: Oldest-first chronological order (default is newest first for most relevant feedback)

## Output Structure

Returns an **array of review threads** (sorted newest first by default, use -o for oldest first):

```json
[
  {
    "thread_id": 123,
    "resolved": false,
    "outdated": false,
    "comments": [
      {
        "comment_id": 123,
        "author": "username",
        "body": "comment text",
        "path": "file/path.js",
        "line": 42,
        "original_line": 40,
        "html_url": "https://...",
        "in_reply_to_id": null,
        "created_at": "2025-01-01T00:00:00Z",
        "updated_at": "2025-01-01T00:00:00Z",
        "commit_id": "abc123"
      }
    ]
  }
]
```

**Key fields:**
- `resolved`/`outdated` - Thread-level status (applies to entire thread)
- `.comments[0]` - Original comment that started the thread
- `.comments[1:]` - Replies in the conversation
- `path`, `line`, `original_line` - File location context for each comment
- `diff_hunk` - Code context (only included with `-f` flag, excluded by default)

**Default behavior:**
- Sorted newest first (use `-o` for oldest first)
- Compact mode (no `diff_hunk` fields, use `-f` to include them)

## Common Use Cases

### 1. Address All Unresolved PR Feedback

When a user asks "address the PR feedback":
1. Fetch actionable threads: Use `-a` flag to get only unresolved, non-outdated threads
2. For each thread, read the referenced file at the specified `path` and `line`
3. Make necessary changes to address the comment
4. Push changes and reply to the comment thread

**Recommended command**: `${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/skills/get-pr-feedback/get-pr-comments.sh -a`

### 2. Understand Reviewer Concerns

When a user asks "what did reviewers say about X":
1. Fetch review threads
2. Filter by file path or search comment bodies for keywords
3. Summarize the concerns and suggestions
4. Provide context from the code being discussed

### 3. Resume Work After Context Loss

When returning to a PR after time away:
1. Fetch actionable threads with `-a` to see what needs attention
2. Threads are sorted newest first, so most recent feedback appears at the top
3. Review the full conversation in each thread (original comment + replies)
4. Address comments starting with the most recent ones

### 4. Analyze Specific Comment Thread

When a user provides a comment URL like `https://github.com/org/repo/pull/123#discussion_r456`:
1. Fetch only that specific thread
2. Read the full conversation context
3. Understand what was already discussed
4. Address the comment with full awareness of the thread history

## Advanced Usage

### Filtering

Use the `-a` flag for actionable threads, or filter manually with jq:

```bash
# Actionable threads (unresolved + not outdated) - built-in with -a flag
${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/skills/get-pr-feedback/get-pr-comments.sh -a

# Or filter manually with jq
${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/skills/get-pr-feedback/get-pr-comments.sh | \
  jq '[.[] | select(.resolved == false and .outdated == false)]'

# By author
jq '[.[] | select(.comments[].author == "username")]'

# By file
jq '[.[] | select(.comments[0].path | contains("filename"))]'

# Count comments in actionable threads
${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/skills/get-pr-feedback/get-pr-comments.sh -a | \
  jq '[.[].comments | length] | add'
```

### Performance Optimization

For large PRs with many comments:
- Use `-a` to filter actionable threads (reduces output size)
- Compact mode is default (no diff_hunks), keeping output small
- Add `-f` only if you need inline code context (increases output by 70%)
- **Automatic fallback**: If output exceeds 25KB, the script writes to a temp file automatically
  - You'll see: `[get-pr-comments] Large output detected - wrote to temp file for Claude to read: /tmp/pr-comments-{owner}-{repo}-{pr}.json`
  - Use the Read tool on this path to access the full data without truncation
  - This bypasses the Bash tool's 30KB limit entirely

## Troubleshooting

**Enable verbose mode** (`-v` flag) to see diagnostic output on stderr:
- Which PR and repository are queried
- Argument parsing details
- Total threads/comments retrieved

**Common issues:**
- **"No PR found"**: Not in git repo, or branch has no PR. Provide explicit PR number/URL.
- **"Cannot access PR"**: Check `gh auth status` and repository permissions.
- **Empty array but comments exist**:
  - With `-a` flag: All threads are resolved or outdated (expected behavior)
  - Without `-a`: Use `-v` to verify correct PR is queried
- **Output seems truncated**: Use `-a` flag to filter first, or ensure PR has <100 threads (GraphQL pagination limit)
- **Missing tools**: Install `gh` (https://cli.github.com/) and `jq`, then run `gh auth login`.

## Notes

- Requires `gh` (GitHub CLI) and `jq` installed and authenticated
- Uses GitHub GraphQL API for accurate `resolved`/`outdated` status
- Returns inline review comments only (not general PR comments)
- Returns empty array `[]` on error with messages to stderr
- **Automatic large output handling**:
  - When output exceeds 25KB, the script automatically writes to a temp file at `/tmp/pr-comments-{owner}-{repo}-{pr}.json`
  - You'll see a message on stderr: `[get-pr-comments] Large output detected - wrote to temp file for Claude to read: {path}`
  - **Important for skills**: When you see this message, use the Read tool on the temp file path instead of parsing stdout
  - This bypasses the Bash tool's 30KB output limit and allows full data access
- Default behavior optimized for performance:
  - Compact mode (no diff_hunks) reduces output size by 70%
  - Newest-first sorting shows most relevant feedback at the top
  - Use `-a` flag for actionable threads to minimize output on large PRs
